# holberton-smiling-school-javascript

<p> In this project, you will finalize the previous project 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).  You will reuse final files of 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and update them.  You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.  You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.</p>
